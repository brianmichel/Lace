## Download

If you'd like to download Marconio, head on over to the [latest release page](https://github.com/brianmichel/Marconio/releases/latest) and download the `.dmg` attached to the release.

This app uses Sparkle to keep itself up to date. After you've installed one version of Marconio from the releases page you can continue to update to later versions from within the app.

## What is Marconio?

It's nothing, but this project used to be called Lace, but in order to ship to the app store you have to pick a name that isn't already taken. So in an reference to [Guglielmo Marconi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi) this is now called Marconio.
