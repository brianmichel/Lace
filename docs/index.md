## About

Marconio is a basic app that lets you stream the wonderful live channels and mixtapes from [NTS](https://nts.live).

It integrates with the macOS level command center now playing widget, as well as the standard play/pause keyboard hot keys and shortcuts. It should feel very similar to any other audio playback app that you've used in the past, just focused to the content on NTS.

If you lke this app, you should support NTS as they are providing an excellent service for free.
